# Demo Website
Want to pack your website into an iOS App? Although adding a direct lint to a website to the home screen is straight forward, not many know how to do it. 

Instead of recreating your whole website as a native iOS app, check first whether you need to. 

All you need to do is is change the following url, build and run.

```swift 
var defaultURLString = "https://joelesli.com";
```
